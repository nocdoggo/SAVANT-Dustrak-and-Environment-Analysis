NCAR/EOL ISS Surface Meteorology Data (ISS2 Farm Field Site)
https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/560.005

Summary
This dataset contains quality-controlled 1-minute surface meteorology data
collected by the NCAR/EOL Integrated Sounding System (ISS) located at the Farm
Field site during the Stable Air Variability and Transport (SAVANT) field
campaign. These data have been checked for quality and are available in NetCDF
format.
