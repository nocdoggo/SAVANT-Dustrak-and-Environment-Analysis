## Nov. 20 Notes

1. Based on DarkSky or National Weather Service data, we will need to list out the hours where the precipitation happened on each day. Say, if the rain happened at 5 PM, and stopped at 8 PM. The data from 5 PM till 1 AM are not usable, since as Dave and Dr. Wang suggested that, within 5 hours after the rain stops, the sensor may be wet, which can potentially affect the measurement.

   Similarly, if the rain starts at 11 AM, stops at 3 PM, then the data till 8 PM wonâ€™t be usable.

   Therefore, please extract out a list of days where the rain/snow period is, so that I can edit the data range accordingly and send it to you with the most updated ones.

2. After we finish the work mentioned above, I will be sending you with all the `stability(R Bulk), temperature, cloud radiation, humidity, cloud coverage, pressure` or any related parameters, to see if any of the parameters have direct relationship to the change of the slope ratio on the non-operation days.

3. During the operation days, we will be seeking for the comparison in between during the drainage flow period, and off drainage flow period. And see how much of an impact does the drainage flow brings to modeling of V vs V<sub>TKE</sub>, and see if can find out anything interesting.
