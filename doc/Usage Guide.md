## Usage Guide

### 0. Getting Started

Please make sure you have ==MATLAB== installed, and the version should be `2018a` at least. Wonder how to find out which one you have installed? Please launch ==MATLAB== and run the following command in ==Command Window==:

```matlab
version
```

You shall see something as:

![MATLAB Check](C:\Users\wzhang77\Documents\GitHub\SAVANT-Dustrak-and-Environment-Analysis\doc\02.PNG)

Next, please download the scripts. If zipped, please unzip and check if the following files are under the same directory:

![Scripts](C:\Users\wzhang77\Documents\GitHub\SAVANT-Dustrak-and-Environment-Analysis\doc\03.PNG)

Then, you are good to go!

---

### 1. Launch Program

Please navigate to the directory where the scripts are, then simply run <kbd>new_render</kbd>. Or run the following command in ==Command Window==:

```matlab
new_render
```

Then, you shall see the ==Command Window== updated as:

![Launched](C:\Users\wzhang77\Documents\GitHub\SAVANT-Dustrak-and-Environment-Analysis\doc\04.PNG)

As shown above, please go to ==Explorer== window where the `.hpl` files are:

![Explorer](C:\Users\wzhang77\Documents\GitHub\SAVANT-Dustrak-and-Environment-Analysis\doc\05.png)

As labeled in the picture above, please make sure you copy and paste the entire file path into the ==Command Window==. Next, go back to the data folder, and obtain the 6 digits tag which you are trying to visualize:

![Digit Tag](C:\Users\wzhang77\Documents\GitHub\SAVANT-Dustrak-and-Environment-Analysis\doc\06.PNG)

Then, type the digits into the ==Command Window==:

![Command 2nd](C:\Users\wzhang77\Documents\GitHub\SAVANT-Dustrak-and-Environment-Analysis\doc\07.PNG)

Next, you will have the selection on how the background should be like:

![Background](C:\Users\wzhang77\Documents\GitHub\SAVANT-Dustrak-and-Environment-Analysis\doc\08.PNG)

The clear one is the same as shown in the `Google Maps` or `Google Earth`. The `Altered` one has blur matt finish on the background. After selecting the background style, you can choose the angle which you should like to visualize:

![Angle Selection](C:\Users\wzhang77\Documents\GitHub\SAVANT-Dustrak-and-Environment-Analysis\doc\09.PNG)

Please wait for a minute or so while all the process finishes. After finishing the visualization, please feel free to interact with it in the ==MATLAB== figure window. No worries, a high 1,200 DPI `.png` file will be saved for each figure under the same directory where the scripts are. When you are done, simple type <kbd>0</kbd> to quit the script.
